Turnitin interview coding test.


Instructions for running the test are in the source code.  Here's the summary:

1) Run the test in an IDE with access to JUnit libraries. Simply right click on the test method and run it.
2) Alternatively, you can remove the JUnit import, the @Test annotation on the test method, and add a call to the method from the default constructor.
